# Notion Books and Notes

This repository contains markdown exports of my **Notion reading list and reference notes**.  Each file corresponds to a book or article from my Notion workspace.  The goal is to keep a version‑controlled record of my readings so I can track progress, add notes and organise projects.

For books that currently have no notes, you will find a template with sections for notes, key takeaways, quotes and a summary.  Feel free to expand these sections as you read.

## Contents

- `New_book.md` – template for a future reading entry.
- `Brave_New_World.md` – Aldous Huxley’s dystopian novel.
- `Crime_and_Punishment.md` – Dostoevsky’s classic on morality and redemption.
- `Sapiens_A_Brief_History_of_Humankind.md` – Yuval Noah Harari’s exploration of human history.
- `Picture_forensic.md` – notes on picture forensics using Belkasoft X【3001246827250†L9-L35】.

Additional books or notes can be added here as needed.  At the end of each file you can include **projects** or exercises to apply the concepts learned.
